When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue 
or slack with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Submitting issues

Bugs and enhancements are tracked in the `issue tracker`_.
Before submitting a new issue, it is always a good idea to check is the
same bug or enhancement already reported. If it is, please add your
comments to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

## Reporting bugs

Explain the bug you have encountered so that others can understand it
and preferably also reproduce it. Key things to have in good bug report:

-  Python version information
-  PuppeteerLibrary and Robot Framework version
-  Steps to reproduce the problem. With more complex problems it is
   often a good idea to create a short, self contained and example.
-  Possible error message and traceback.

Notice that all information in the issue tracker is public. Do not
include any confidential information there.

## Enhancement requests

Describe the new feature and use cases for it in as much detail as
possible in an issue. Especially with larger enhancements, be prepared to
contribute the code in form of a pull request as explained below or to
pay someone for the work. Consider also would it be better to implement this
functionality as a separate library outside the PuppeteerLibrary.

## Pull requests

On GitHub pull requests are the main mechanism to contribute code. They
are easy to use both for the contributor and for person accepting the
contribution, and with more complex contributions it is easy also for
others to join the discussion. Preconditions for creating a pull
requests are having a `GitHub account`, installing `Git` and forking the
`PuppeteerLibrary project`. 

Please always ensure that all test pass before create a pull request.
